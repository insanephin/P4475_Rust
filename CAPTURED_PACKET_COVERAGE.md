# Retained P4475 packet-trace coverage

Last updated: 2026-08-11

This ledger records the read-only audit of
`C:\Users\drash\Documents\kartrider\KartRider_4475\logs`. The capture files
remain external evidence and are not copied into this repository.

## Corpus boundary

- 49 `packet-trace_*.log` files were inspected; 35 contain packet records and
  14 contain headers only.
- Six `server-ui_*.log` files were also checked for corroborating server
  behavior.
- The packet traces contain 19,496 incoming records and 100 distinct incoming
  hashes: 97 on TCP, three on game UDP, and two on P2P UDP. The UDP sets
  overlap, so those counts do not add to 100.
- 72 incoming hashes were already classified by a Rust transport or protocol
  domain. The 28 TCP hashes below were the previously unclassified set.
- A `covered` row means Rust validates every retained producer shape for that
  hash and performs the stated response/state transition. All 28 rows are now
  covered; hashes outside the owned domains still fail closed as
  `UnsupportedIdentityPacket`.

| `PqSendMacroChat` | 13 | covered | Resolves the bound profile quick-message table and atomically relays racer/observer messages in every room phase; global or team-zero messages reach all peers, while nonzero teams keep the C# team filter |

## Initialization result

The failing Rust run ended on the exact five-byte request
`BD 05 4C 2D 01` (`SpRqKoinBalance`). The old parser accepted only the
four-byte hash and rejected the terminal `01` as trailing data. All 56 Koin
requests in 28 retained packet traces use that same five-byte shape.

The common captured flow immediately after Koin is:

1. `PqFavoriteItemGet`
2. `PqLockedItemGet`
3. `PqFavoriteTrackMapGet`
4. `PqGetFavoriteChannel`
5. `PqAddTimeEventTimerPacket`
6. `PqCheckMyClubStatePacket`
7. `LoRqSetRiderItemOnPacket`
8. `PqChannelSwitch`

Those requests were already owned by Rust domains before this audit. The 28
rows above first appear after additional menu, scenario, time-attack, room, or
race paths, but they are now covered as well.

## Race completion control packet

- The retained stock trace contains normal 406-byte incoming
  `GameControlPacket` finish reports (`state=2`): after the 13-byte parsed
  control prefix, the client carries a 393-byte result snapshot. Rust decodes
  its confirmed `value1/value2`, seven-word session envelope, 54-byte
  subobject, global metric, 243-byte physics snapshot, shared timestamp,
  eight participant slots, local result, and terminal state. It is diagnostic
  only: race settlement still uses the server-owned transition and finish
  result. Other control extensions remain bounded at 512 bytes, while a
  513-byte tail is rejected. This fixes the prior Rust-only 256-byte rejection
  that disconnected the client at race completion.

## Additional static-audit handlers

- The retained corpus covers `GrRequestBasicAiPacket` add/remove requests but
  does not contain a controlled Easy/Hard/Hell comparison. Static client
  codecs close the ownership boundary instead: the request is only
  `player_id:u32 + option:u8`, the 13-byte AI slot body is loadout/team, and
  `GrCommandStartPacket` owns one counted 24-byte/six-float spec per AI. The
  current fixed Rust values are therefore compatible but do not constitute a
  capture-verified difficulty preset. See
  [AI_DIFFICULTY_AUDIT.md](AI_DIFFICULTY_AUDIT.md).

- `PcStartMatching` now validates its exact 32-byte seven-word session/auth
  envelope and returns the complete seven-byte `PcMatchingFound` empty/create
  variant (`hash | 00 00 00`). `PcCancelMatching` is an exact hash-only
  authenticated no-reply. Rust intentionally does not copy C#'s arbitrary
  visible-room selection: actor-owned matchmaking needs an explicit pairing
  policy and a two-client capture.
- GameSlot type 10/16 preserves wire-offset bytes 18/19 and the ancillary
  effect code as raw/effect-specific values. Type 16 is not treated as a
  barricade-only packet.

## TCP GameSlot replay

- The retained RX corpus contains 1,471 TCP `GameSlotPacket` records: type
  1=`43`, type 2=`22`, type 9=`1,337`, type 10=`38`, type 11=`1`, and type
  12=`30`.
- The opt-in audit now passes every one of those records through
  `parse_game_slot_packet`; dispatcher hash ownership alone is no longer
  counted as GameSlot coverage.
- Type 1/2 frames are now parser-minted pickup capabilities rather than raw
  relay packets. The World actor accepts them only from the exact frozen human
  racer in item game types 2/4. All 65 retained requests also prove the strict
  pre-award state and repeated object/tick/state/owner relations. Actor-owned
  per-player monotonic tokens reject replay/stale tuples, while a six-token,
  four-per-second bucket preserves the observed maximum three-event burst and
  bounds fabricated increasing ticks. The explicit rank policy defaults to
  trusting client-reported rank for the current LAN/friends model and can be
  switched to Combined fallback. The actor replaces bytes 38..40 with the
  selected item and atomically broadcasts the exact 73-byte result to all
  active frozen recipients including the sender. C# source plus deterministic
  Rust fixtures prove the response layout; a fresh two-client response capture
  remains an E2E gate.
- The original 30 type-12 corpus records comprise Course state 0/1 with count
  4, Banana state 2, Rocket state 2, and Barricade state 1 shapes. A subsequent
  runtime capture (`p4475-1785508674395-18928.log`) adds reachable Barricade
  state 3 and state 2 forms with exact 25-byte raw bodies after a collision.
  Those exact state forms carry retained trace evidence and require their
  nested owner to match the claimed sender. Other known type-12 pairs use the
  bounded sender-excluded compatibility relay after common envelope and peer
  mask validation; they cannot mutate Rust world state. The 67-class manifest
  remains typed diagnostic evidence rather than a per-capture routing gate.
- No retained RX record proves type 4, 6, or 16 routing, arbitrary
  static-writer state reachability, or object ownership. Those are explicit
  capture gaps rather than inferred compatibility claims.

## Safety decision

An early audit patch treated every captured length as a successful no-reply
compatibility request. Independent review rejected that policy because it
would discard required replies, broadcasts, and durable mutations while
making the session appear healthy. The replacement assigns each request to an
owning abstraction: terminal query, actor-owned lobby mutation, durable
profile transition, single-player state machine, client event, or bounded
telemetry. No blanket captured-hash fallback exists.

The C# implementation is not cloned when its behavior is unsafe or
non-authoritative. Rust uses checked Lucci arithmetic, denies a finish replay,
persists before emitting success, does not accept client anti-cheat telemetry
as authority, and does not enable the disabled C# relay branch.

## Verification

- The opt-in test
  `session::tests::external_retained_packet_corpus_matches_the_dispatch_domains`
  reads the external directory through `P4475_PACKET_TRACE_DIR`.
- It revalidated all 19,496 incoming records and 100 distinct hashes. All 97
  TCP hashes resolve through composed Rust dispatch domains; every actual
  packet belonging to the former 28-hash gap is fully parsed; every retained
  Game/P2P UDP packet is decoded by the routed UDP codec; and all 1,471 TCP
  GameSlot records cross the strict GameSlot parser.
- This is protocol/corpus coverage, not a claim that a fresh stock client has
  completed every UI and multiplayer path. A new stock-client startup run and
  the two-machine LAN multiplayer E2E remain separate gates.
